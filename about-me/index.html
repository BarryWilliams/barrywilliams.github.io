<p>I am a father of four beautiful girls, and husband to my beautiful wife.
<img src="family.png" alt="My Family"></p>
<p>I grew up all over. I&rsquo;ve lived in Georgia, California, Florida, Tennessee and Colorado. I have lived the most in Georgia.</p>
<p>I met my wife in Athens, GA. We both worked at Food Lion and over a couple years we became best friends. She is my rock. Five years later we were married. Over ten years we had four wonderful kids.</p>
<p>I served a two-year mission in Nashville, Tennessee for my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It was very trying, but also very rewarding. I love seeing people make changes in their life for the better. My membership in the church is deeply embedded in my identity and gives me a strong purpose in life. I recognize that all good things in my life have been a result of my faith.</p>
<h2 id="computers">Computers</h2>
<p>I have been writing software since I was 8 years old. My first program was in BASIC, it went something like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-basic" data-lang="basic">10 print <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello there&#34;</span>
20 goto <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I became interested in Fractals around age 14. I found programs like <code>fractint</code>, which would generate fractal pictures. I decided to build one on my own, outputting to EGA graphics (if anyone remembers that). I even wrote my own fractal formula in high school, which I developed on my TI-83 while I was bored in Algebra. I also wrote a pretty advanced version of Battleship on my TI-83 - also bored in Algebra.</p>
<p>I took AP Computer Science, where I learned C++ and abandoned BASIC forever. I re-wrote my fractal programs in C++ so that I could get better performance. In college I learned Java. On my first job I learned Ruby (which I fell in love with). I am now familiar with a host of programming languages.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was very interested in computer hardware. I&rsquo;m sure my dad remembers me always messing with our 486 at home - he would have to figure out how to fix it after I made some fatal settings in the BIOS.</p>
<p>One year at scout camp, I took the Computers merit badge. The instructors were really cool - they gave me some old PCs, a couple monitors and keyboards - my mom was thrilled (not). I learned so much from those computers - mostly what not to do when working on the hardware. I remember the sad day when I fried my Maxtor 6.4GB hard drive which I paid for with my own money. If you were to look back at my bedroom, it was an explosion of computer parts and half-baked experiments - I wish I had some pictures.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I have always enjoyed music. My tastes have changed over time. When I was 12, I started listening to Oldies (1950s) on the radio, then I started listening to Alternative rock on 99x in Atlanta - which was the best radio station at the time. In college I was exposed to electronic music, which I gravitated toward Trance. Electronic music has stuck with me the most. I even work to it.</p>
<p>I began DJing when I was 20. I remember walking to work (at Family Dollar no less) in Athens, GA, listening to albums by The Chemical Brothers, Crystal Method, live sets from Sven Vath, Ferry Corsten, Armin Van Buuren, and so much more. I was captivated by how artists would keep the music going by beat-matching songs. I decided to try it, so I got a copy of <code>Mix Meister</code> where I would do experiments and learn how to mix.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-767492019/custom-dance-mix-2003-11">my favorite mix</a>, I used <code>Acid Pro</code> to tightly mix several songs. I was inspired by the live album <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theclassicmixcdseries/on-the-floor-at-the-boutique-fatboy-slim">Fatboy Slim - On The Floor At The Boutique</a>. I loved the stereophonic effects he used - toying with playing two songs at one time, but on separate channels. I decided to experiment with similar stereo effects and came up with a 13 minute mix - which I still regard as my most technical mix. I recommend listening to it with headphones.</p>
<p>Later in life I would DJ at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGHR_(Georgia)">Green Hornet Radio</a> playing progressive house and trance. I loved how the music would create amazing soundscapes.</p>
<h2 id="rockets">Rockets</h2>
<p>I love building rockets. There is nothing like the feeling of setting off a controlled explosion and watching something roar into the sky. In the summer of 2010 I decided to build a rocket using only things you could find around the home. I guess you could say I was bored. I had been making homemade rockets for a long-time, but this time I really wanted to go wild on it. I had designed a type of water-bottle rocket with a soda bottle as the base, Hydrogen and Oxygen as fuel, and some water left at the bottom to get better propulsion.</p>
<p>Where did I the fuel, you say? Electrolysis of course. I had a 5 gallon bucket filled with water, using baking soda as an electrolyte. I had built a crude AC to DC converter with a bridge rectifier plugged directly into the wall. I then used gouging rods as the electrodes, since they were made of graphite. I used a system of soda bottles to collect the gasses, as well as an interesting system of pipes to fill my rocket with fuel.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckqLy0l8jPk">this video</a> for one of my launches.</p>
<h2 id="cooking">Cooking</h2>
<h3 id="sous-vide">Sous Vide</h3>
<p>A while ago, I was fascinated when I heard that you could cook food (safely) by placing food in a temperature-controlled water bath. First you prepare the food with seasonings, then you vacuum pack the food, submerge the food in the water bath, and then some finishing when you are done. This style of cooking works especially well with meat. See <a href="https://youtu.be/dee5FwKOnkM">this video</a> - Guga is the best.</p>
<p>Cooking this way has spoiled me with steak. It comes out perfect every time. I am now so hard to please when I go to steak restaurants. The best part is that you can buy the meat on sale, prepare it, vacuum pack it, freeze it, then cook it whenever you want steak.</p>
<h3 id="bbq">BBQ</h3>
<p>In 2013 my dad gave me his old (rather rusty) New Braunfels smoker. I remember the wonderful pork loin my dad cooked as a kid. My first trail was cooking pulled pork using <a href="https://www.thesmokerking.com/page1e.html">this recipe</a>. Which turned out successful. I have made some modifications. The biggest modification is not cooking for 24 hours, but instead cooking it half in the smoker and half in the oven in a tray. I use the left over juice from the oven and mix it back in when pulling the pork.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also done some very experimental BBQ. The craziest thing I ever did was re-use my high-voltage machine, which I built for a home-made rocket project, to increase the penetration of smoke (inspired by <a href="https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/srasmokeparticles.html">this article</a>). I placed an electrode in the pork shoulder and a wire mesh as the other electrode. The idea was that smoke would pass through the mesh, pick up extra electrons, then become attracted to the meat. I am happy to report that my machine held up for 12 hours, but sadly there was actually less smoke on my test shoulder than my control. I think I must have reversed the electrodes. Nevertheless, I think this still counts as a decent proof of concept. I never did the experiment again over concerns that electrolysis might cause undesired (or even unsafe) chemical changes to the meat.</p>
<p>My most recent experiment (as of this writing) was cooking half on the smoker, and then half using Sous Vide. I then put it in the oven briefly to crisp the outside and finish the &ldquo;bark&rdquo;. It was really tasty! It&rsquo;s all cheating, I know, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<h3 id="sodas">Sodas</h3>
<p>Oh yes, I even dabble in crafting my own soda. A while back I bought a 64 fl.oz. beer keg, which I use to carbonate drinks. I have a few that have been hits with the family - and some that were more flops. The most popular was my Cherry-Limeade Cream soda.</p>
